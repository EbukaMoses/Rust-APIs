# Rust API Projects 🦀

This repository is a collection of different API projects I’m building while learning how to use **Rust** for backend and API development.
It serves as both a **learning journey** and a **reference point** for experimenting with various frameworks, patterns, and best practices in Rust web development.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repo represents a different API project.

```
rust-api-projects/
│
├── todo_app/          # A simple CRUD API for managing tasks
├── auth_service/      # Authentication and authorization API
├── blog_api/          # Blog posts and comments API
├── ecommerce_api/     # E-commerce backend (products, orders, users)
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

* Practice building **RESTful APIs** in Rust.
* Explore frameworks like **Actix Web**, **Axum**, and **Rocket**.
* Learn how to structure projects, handle routing, and manage state.
* Implement features like authentication, database integration, and error handling.
* Document the progress as a **Rust API learning journey**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Rust 🦀
* **Frameworks:** Actix Web, Axum, Rocket (depending on project)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite (via Diesel or SQLx)
* **Other Tools:**

  * Serde (serialization & deserialization)
  * Reqwest (HTTP client)
  * Tokio (async runtime)

---

## 📌 How to Run a Project

Navigate into the project folder you want to run, then use:

```bash
cd todo_app
cargo run
```

For projects with a database, make sure to set up the environment variables (check the project’s `README.md` for details).

## 📖 Learning Notes

I’ll also add notes or docs along the way to track what I’m learning about:

* Rust ownership & lifetimes in API context
* Async programming with `tokio`
* Error handling strategies
* Clean architecture for APIs

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Add integration tests for all APIs
* Explore GraphQL APIs with Rust
* Deploy sample APIs to cloud platforms
* Add Docker support for easy setup

---

## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily a personal learning repo, but feel free to:

* Suggest improvements
* Share learning resources
* Open issues or PRs if you spot something
